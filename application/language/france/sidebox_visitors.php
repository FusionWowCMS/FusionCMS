/**
 * Note to module developers:
 *  Keeping a module specific language file like this
 *  in this external folder is not a good practise for
 *  portability - I do not advice you to do this for
 *  your own modules since they are non-default.
 *  Instead, simply put your language files in
 *  application/modules/yourModule/language/
 *  You do not need to change any code, the system
 *  will automatically look in that folder too.
